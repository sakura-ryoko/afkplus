# AfkPlus Fabric Mod for Minecraft

![Example](https://sakuraryoko.com/files/1260026/afkplus.jpg)

## Basic Description:
- A forked project based upon AfkDisplay by beabfc.  He has given me his blessing with proceeding to create this mod, look under my Archived Issues pane.
- Show which players are AFK in the player list, see the Reasons, Durations, and Times.
- Fully configurable and with [Placeholder API](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/general/), which includes all Placeholder API formatting nodes such as: yellow or bold natively. (You can even include a URL in your AFK Reason!)
- Mod can now be used on Single Player, and Integrated Servers (Open to LAN).

## Features :blush:
- Added a placeholder `%afkplus:afk%` for you to offer a very basic '**[AFK]**' tag to players who are AFK.
- Added a placeholder `%afkplus:name%`/`%afkplus:display_name%` so that you can use this as a replacement for the '**%player:displayname%**' placeholder under other Mods, such as [Styled Playerlist](https://modrinth.com/mod/styledplayerlist "Styled Playerlist").
***NOTE that this method was designed to be fully compliant with LuckPerms Prefixes under Styled Playerlist, because the standard method for playerlist updating fails, or you can simply use %afkplus:afk% to add formatting to existing names if you like.***
- Added a placeholder `%afkplus:duration%` so that you can get the time since someone went AFK, with configuration for a format prefix.
- Added a placeholder `%afkplus:time%` so that you can get the Time/Date when someone went AFK, with configuration for a format prefix.
- Added a placeholder `%afkplus:reason%` so that you can port the Afk Reason for why someone went AFK, with configuration for a format prefix.
- Added a placeholder `%afkplus:invulnerable%` so that you can display the "Disable Damage" status for all users, similar to the "[AFK]" placeholder tag, but more or less an "add on".
- There is a special configuration option 'prettyDuration' to configure the AFK Duration in a more human-readable format, instead of the default (HH:mm:ss.mss) format.  Each method has its advantages though. ([Styled Nicknames](https://modrinth.com/mod/styled-nicknames) or [Styled Chat](https://modrinth.com/mod/styled-chat) comes to mind here)
- There are several mod / data pack conflict warnings for administrators to help them make better decisions on what mods they want to install.
- Added a "disableDamage" configuration to make AFK players immune to damage after a 15-second cool down.  A new configurable server-wide message is now enforced by default when this occurs.
- Added a "disableDamageCooldown" configuration to allow Administrators to adjust the default "timer" that is applied after a player goes AFK.  I highly recommend not setting this to '0', unless you don't think your players will abuse this privilege.
- Added a "whenDamageDisabled" configuration so that you can customize the message displayed when your players are marked as invulnerable.
- Added a "whenDamageEnabled" configuration so that you can customize the message displayed when your players are unmarked as invulnerable.
- Now also checks for if players are in Spectator Mode, and not only Creative for managing your AFK/Disable Damage status.
- [NEW] Adds several color nodes that players can use for AFK Reasons.  See /afkex for a display example.
  - brown, cyan, dark_brown, dark_pink, light_blue, light_brown, light_gray, light_pink, lime, magenta, purple, salmon,
  - bluetiful, burnt_orange, canary, cool_mint, copper, powder_blue, royal_purple, shamrock, tickle_me_pink, ultramarine_blue
- [NEW] Added a "bypassSleepCount" configuration so that you can allow players marked as Afk to bypass the Sleeping Requirements.
- [NEW] Added a "bypassInsomnia" configuration so that you can allow players marked as Afk to block Phantom spawning.
- [NEW] Added a "/noafk" command for players to stop themselves from being marked as Afk.
- [NEW] Added a "displayDuration" configuration option so that you can enable/disable the "Gone for XX minutes, XX seconds" during whenReturn.
- [NEW] Added additional handling to allow "afkTimeoutString" to be set to "", and passing the "defaultReason" as "" to have more of the "Original" AfkDisplay feel.
- [NEW] Added a new "AFK Kick" system to automatically kick players from the server who are AFK after a configured amount of time.  It has several configuration options:
  - `afkKickEnabled` - (true/false) Enables the AFK Auto Kick manager.
  - `afkKickNonSurvival` - (true/false) Allows Kicking Creative / Spectator players.
  - `afkKickTimer` - The time beyond `timeoutSeconds` (Additive) when a player gets removed from the server, so if `timeoutSeconds` is 240, and `afkKickTimer` is set to 3600, the actual time they get kicked is at **3840**, or 64 minutes at the longest.
  - `afkKickSafePermissions` - (Permission 3) The default Permissions level that is marked "safe" from being automatically kicked. (Luck Perms: afkplus.kick.safe)
    - Note; that if a player has `afkPlusCommandPermissions` (Luck Perms: afkplus.afkplus), they will also be marked as safe from being automatically kicked, but this new configuration allows you to configure these permissions separately.
  - `afkKickMessage` - The message sent to Players that get kicked as the reason for their removal. (Adds the Duration when `displayDuration` is enabled)
  - `whenKicked` - The message broadcast to the server when a player gets kicked for being AFK. (Adds the Duration when `displayDuration` is enabled)
  - NOTES: This feature *DOES NOT* automatically kick Carpet Mod Bots, because the 'fake' players do not get ticked by the server.
    - This feature *DOES NOT* work in Single Player/Open To Lan, and requires a Dedicated Server Environment to function properly.

## Potential known conflicts (Make your choice)
- [afk display Data pack](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/) (Vanilla Tweaks Data pack, changes the player list display) -- Mod checks for any "afk" containing data packs in the name.
- [AfkDisplay](https://modrinth.com/mod/afkdisplay) -- because this is the mod that AfkPlus is based upon, and offers fewer features.
- [AntiLogout](https://modrinth.com/mod/noexits) (/afk command, timeout handling)
- [Auto AFK](https://modrinth.com/mod/auto-afk) (/afk command, timeout handling)
- [Sessility](https://modrinth.com/mod/sessility) (timeout handling)
- [Playtime-Tracker](https://modrinth.com/mod/playtime-tracker) (timeout handling)
- [SvrUtil](https://modrinth.com/mod/svrutil) (/afk command, the rest is safe)
