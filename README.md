# AfkPlus Fabric Mod for Minecraft

![Example](afkplus.jpg)

## Basic Description:
- A forked project based upon AfkDisplay by beabfc
- Show which players are AFK in the player list, see the Reasons, Durations, and Times.
- Fully configurable and with [Placeholder API](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/general/), which includes all Placeholder API formatting nodes such as: yellow or bold natively. (You can even include a URL in your AFK Reason!)
- Mod can now be used on Single Player, and Integrated Servers (Open to LAN).

## Features :blush:
- '**/afkplus reload**' command.  This allows an Administrator to reload the configuration while the server is running. (Permission: afkplus.afkplus.reload)
- '**/afkplus set [Player] [Reason]**' command.  This allows any administrator to set the AFK status of a player. (Permission: afkplus.afkplus.set)
- '**/afkplus clear [Player]**' command.  This allows any administrator to clear the AFK status of a player. (Permission: afkplus.afkplus.clear)
- '**/afkplus info [Player]**' command.  This allows any administrator to check the AFK status of a player, and display the time and duration since they went AFK. (Permission: afkplus.afkplus.info)
- '**/afkplus update [Player]**' command.  This allows any administrator to force a player list update for a player. (Permission: afkplus.afkplus.update)
- '**/afkinfo [Player]**' command.  Does the same thing as '**/afkplus info [Player]**', but can be used for Mods, or players, or however you like to configure it for people to see. (Permission: afkplus.afkinfo)
- '**/afk [Reason]**' This allows any user to use a [Reason] along with setting their AKF status.
- **[PERMISSIONS]**: Security permissions for the '**/afkplus**' command via [Luck Permissions](https://luckperms.net/) with the AfkPlusCommandPermissions setting the default restrictions, the '**/afk**' and '**/afkinfo**' command also has restrictions using AfkCommandPermissions/AfkInfoCommandPermissions setting as well.
- Added a placeholder '**%afkplus:name%**' so that you can use this as a replacement for the '**%player:displayname%**' placeholder under other Mods, such as [Styled Playerlist](https://modrinth.com/mod/styledplayerlist "Styled Playerlist").
***NOTE that this method was designed to be fully compliant with LuckPerms Prefixes under Styled Playerlist, because the standard method for playerlist updating fails, or you can simply use %afkplus:afk% to add formatting to existing names if you like.***
- Placeholder '**%afkplus:duration%**' so that you can get the time since someone went AFK, with configuration for a format prefix.
- Placeholder '**%afkplus:time%**' so that you can get the Time/Date when someone went AFK, with configuration for a format prefix.
- Placeholder '**%afkplus:reason%**' so that you can port the Afk Reason for why someone went AFK, with configuration for a format prefix.
- Placeholder '**%afkplus:afk%**' for you to offer a very basic '**[AFK]**' tag to player's who are AFK.
- There is a special configuration option 'prettyDuration' to configure the AFK Duration in a more human-readable format, instead of the default (HH:mm:ss.mss) Apache format, each method has it's advantages though. ([Styled Nicknames](https://modrinth.com/mod/styled-nicknames) or [Styled Chat](https://modrinth.com/mod/styled-chat) comes to mind here)
- There are several mod / data pack conflict warnings for administrator's to help them make better decisions on what mods they want to install.

## Potential known conflicts (Make your choice)
- [afk display Data pack](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/) (Vanilla Tweaks Data pack, changes player list display) -- Mod checks for any "afk" containing data packs in the name.
- [AfkDisplay](https://modrinth.com/mod/afkdisplay) -- because this is the mod that AfkPlus is based upon, and offers less features.
- [SvrUtil](https://modrinth.com/mod/svrutil) (/afk command, rest is safe)
- [AntiLogout](https://modrinth.com/mod/noexits) (/afk command, timeout handling)
- [Sessility](https://modrinth.com/mod/sessility) (timeout handling)
- [Playtime-Tracker](https://modrinth.com/mod/playtime-tracker) (timeout handling)
